# PCET COVID TASK FORCE

We are a committee of students trying to help society through this pandemic situation because we believe 'Helping one person might not change the world, but it could change the world for one person!

# Our Mission
To help our students, alumni, and their immediate family members, we have created PCET STUDENTS COVID TASK FORCE, which will try to help the concerned people. We try to provide help in areas like Lab Testing, Hospital admission, Oxygen bed, Ventilator, Plasma, Medicines, Moral Support, Arranging Isolation Beds, Medical suggestions from Doctors, etc.
